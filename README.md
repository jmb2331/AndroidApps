# About

In this repo, I am working through the projects in the book [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/) . The projects include/will include:

- GeoQuiz
- CriminalIntent
- HelloMoon
- NerdLauncher
- RemoteControl
- PhotoGallery
- DragAndDraw
- RunTracker

The programming languages used to develope these android applications are:
- Java
- XML


### Why
  I have decided to share my code in order for recruiters and other engineers to see my style. All of the code here is written by me
  and I do not give permission for anyone to copy.
  
  #### Goals
   My goal of this repository is to share my progression as a mobile app developer and to have a nice way of looking back at my code that can be easily pulled. 
   
   ### Installation

These mobile apps require [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) in order to run. In order to test the apps through an android device emulator, you will need to create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) in the IDE. 
  
   #### Contact
   I am currently looking for a full-time role in the embedded software or related fields. If you have any suggestions or think that I would be a good contributor to a project at a company please feel free to contact me.
